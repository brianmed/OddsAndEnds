# OddsAndEnds

There are three utilities here.

One is
[columns](https://github.com/brianmed/OddsAndEnds/blob/main/columns/README.md).
It's similar to cut(1) except that reverse ranges are supported, indexes from
the end are allowed (e.g. ^0), and ranges are 0 based indexes.

Another is
[stream](https://github.com/brianmed/OddsAndEnds/blob/main/stream/README.md).
It's a utility that is a line oriented find and replace.

Lastly is
[psort](https://github.com/brianmed/OddsAndEnds/blob/main/psort/README.md).
Line oriented sort, possibly uniquely, with the sorted output displayed in
sets, every s seconds.
